[00:01.44] Take my love, take my heart
[00:04.88] (Enter a world with our new memories)
[00:07.40] Do it for love, do it for you
[00:10.68] (Let me show you my secret passion)
[00:28.18] 
[00:34.69] Hate the dark, born to shine
[00:37.35] My heart's beating for you (all night long)
[00:40.64] No streetlights, loading so fast
[00:43.39] No matter what I do
[00:52.89] 
[00:46.84] Get down, move it on (non-stop speed)
[00:50.01] Too high, locked right on me (heat emotion)
[00:52.99] You're staring straight at the finish line (I always support you)
[00:57.95] Now I want to watch over all (my secret feelings)
[01:22.45] 
[01:01.82] Crazy love, crazy love, crazy love
[01:03.72] I know that you can't be with me now (we have different minds)
[01:07.45] So many times we could choose to love
[01:10.18] So I'll reach out and grab your hand (don't let go)
[01:35.68] 
[01:13.64] Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love like fire
[01:16.58] Until this world will end (just wanna dream with you)
[01:19.74] Nobody can stop me right now
[01:22.34] Bright roses into my heart
[01:35.34] 
[01:37.59] Lying is hard, make me so sad
[01:40.59] But I pray that you'll be fine (day after day)
[01:43.65] Long distance, lonely dance
[01:46.34] This life is my only one
[01:58.34] 
[01:49.91] Stand by, turn on and off (charge speed)
[01:53.13] Virtual reality (sympathy)
[01:56.16] Hold on, 'cause I am not ready to go (I'll try to be brave)
[02:00.95] Now I want to tell you again (accept my feelings)
[02:25.45] 
[02:04.75] Crazy love, crazy love, crazy love
[02:06.50] I know that you can't be with me now (you spark joy for me)
[02:10.86] When I'm alone without you
[02:13.20] I close my eyes, think of your face (can't stop motion)
[02:40.70] 
[02:16.79] Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love like fire
[02:19.66] Until this world will end (just wanna dream with you)
[02:22.58] Don't be afraid to go beyond
[02:25.27] Burning roses deep in your soul
[02:40.77] 
[03:04.82] Get down, move it on (non-stop speed)
[03:08.02] Too high, locked right on me (heat emotion)
[03:11.27] You're staring straight at the finish line (I always support you)
[03:16.06] Now I want to watch over all (my secret feelings)
[03:40.56] 
[03:19.84] Crazy love, crazy love, crazy love
[03:21.66] I know that you can't be with me now (we have different minds)
[03:25.41] So many times we could choose to love
[03:28.16] So I'll reach out and grab your hand (don't let go)
[03:53.66] 
[03:31.68] Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love like fire
[03:34.56] Until this world will end (just wanna dream with you)
[03:37.55] Nobody can stop me right now
[03:40.23] Bright roses into my heart
